<div style="text-align: justify">Good quality sleep has a profound impact on our overall health. It strengthens our immune system, boosts cognitive function, improves mood, and enhances memory. Conversely, poor sleep quality can lead to a cascade of negative consequences, including:
<br>
<br>
- Increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
<br>
- Difficulty concentrating and learning.
<br>
- Irritability and mood swings.
<br>
- Decreased energy levels and motivation.
<br>
<br>
In this Article, I'm using Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle. The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. This article use several variables details such as gender, age, sleep duration, quality of sleep, stress levels, BMI category, heart rate, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Credit risks are a commonly observed phenomenon in areas of finance that relate to mortgages, credit cards, and other kinds of loans. There is always a probability that the borrower may not get back with the amount. So this project aim is to predict the loan status (default or non-default) based on the given features related to the borrower and the loan itself.</div>
