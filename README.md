# Triasto Adhinugroho | Data Insight Developer

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

My journey revolves around uncovering hidden stories within information and bringing them to life through thoughtful visualization. While studying at Pacmann Academy's Data Science program, I've discovered my passion for turning raw numbers into meaningful insights that people can actually use.

Sports figures and health information particularly catch my interest. I see each dataset as a mystery with clues scattered throughout. What drives me is the moment when a visualization clicks and suddenly makes sense to someone who previously couldn't see the pattern.

Looking ahead, I'm eager to contribute my skills to organizations that value both analytical depth and clear communication, especially in areas like sports analytics, health metrics, or understanding what drives consumer choices.
